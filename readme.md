## 📌 Project Overview  
This repository contains my project **“Supplier Insights for Product Quality Optimization”**, built during the **DataCamp Python Data Associate Certification**.  

While the certification tested technical skills, I extended it into a **real-world business case**:  
🔹 How supplier type and material usage affect final product quality.  
🔹 How to clean messy data and extract actionable insights.  
🔹 How businesses can make **data-driven decisions** for cost savings & quality improvement.

## 🚀 Business Value  
This project directly addresses real-world challenges in **manufacturing & supply chain management**:  

- ✅ **Supplier Performance:** Identify which suppliers consistently provide higher-quality raw materials.  
- ✅ **Material Optimization:** Find the “sweet spot” for pigment usage that balances cost and quality.  
- ✅ **Data Integrity:** Build trust in decision-making by cleaning and validating production datasets.  
- ✅ **Targeted Quality Improvements:** Detect conditions that lead to poor quality and recommend fixes.  

📊 **Impact** → Companies can **reduce costs, negotiate better contracts, minimize waste, and boost product quality** with the insights from this analysis.
